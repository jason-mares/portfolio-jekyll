Much like every professional on earth, I've had some bad clients. From the rude, to the demanding, to the ignorant and to drug addicts that completely derailed projects—I've seen a lot. Early in my career, I was introduced to <a href="https://clientsfromhell.net/" target="_blank">Clients from Hell</a>, a website where designers and other creative professionals go to post horror stories about their terrible clients. Every story featured seemed to be channeling some sort of frustration I was experiencing in my own freelance career and it made me not feel so alone. However as I grew professionally I began to see the cracks websites like this create inside a designer’s mind.

I'm here to tell you Clients from Hell and many websites like it are bringing down the entire craft to the level of boors and you should stop complaining about bad clients if you want a fulfilling career. Here are three reasons why I've had the change of heart.

<h4>1) It Violates the Spirit of Confidentiality</h4>

When I was 27 I had a mental breakdown that nearly ruined my relationship with my then girlfriend (now wife). I knew it was time to see a therapist for some serious life intervention. After a few months of therapy, I got better and began fixing the wrongs in my life. Was I the best patient? Probably not. In fact, some of the things I spoke about probably weren't that big of a deal compared to my doctor's other patients and I asked some ignorant questions that were obvious to my doctor but not to me.

How do you think I would have felt if I read my story on a website called <i>Patients from Hell</i> where therapists would trash talk people like me? How would you feel? How would that shape your opinion of the entire field of psychotherapy? As a medical professional, therapists hear things that would make a lot of us go slightly insane but I would hope that you'd expect a medical professional to be courteous and understanding and not at all snide and spiteful enough to turn your real pain and misery into a eye rolling story for their colleagues to laugh at.

When a designer posts something on Clients From Hell they reduce real human beings to punchlines, making it that much harder to treat new clients with respect and empathy. Not every client you meet will be a design guru, many don't deal with design on a day-to-day basis and they will at times ask some dumb questions and say ignorant things—that's just part of the job. What’s not part of a designer’s job is to flaunt your design prowess in a way that makes them feel dumb. As a representative of our craft it's our job to educate clients about design the best way we can. It's not just good business it's good manners.

<i>"But posts on CFH don't call out the clients by name so it can’t violate confidentiality"</i> some might say. That doesn't make it okay. As a rule of thumb, never post anything on the internet you wouldn't feel comfortable saying directly to the person's face. You can be a working professional or a troll, not both.

<h4>2) Nearly Every Post Highlights a Designer's Mistake and Nobody Helps Them Learn From It</h4>

Behind nearly every post there's a designer struggling with the professional or personable aspect of the craft. Let’s take a look at these three actual Clients from Hell Posts:

<blockquote>
Me: You mentioned that you need a green arrow image. Do you know what size you need it to be?
<br>
Client: Petite.
</blockquote>

Clearly this is not an informed answer, but why are you asking the client how big they want a graphic? You're the designer. Good clients don't want to answer design questions because it makes them feel uncomfortable. Throw in the fact that many clients believe you’re a “creative” yet here you are asking them a “creative” question when they’re intimidated and confused by the “creative” label. How would you feel if your auto mechanic said "you mentioned that you need your engine fixed, do you know what displacement you need it to be?" Even if you knew, a mechanic that has to ask this question isn't inspiring a lot of confidence in his customers and inviting uninformed answers.

A better way to handle this would be to tell the client “here are three sizes of the green arrow, I believe option one works best for your application but here are two other options for you to choose from.” What our designer above did was equivalent to being a server at a mexican restaurant being asked “what’s good on the menu” and saying “everything’s good” then rolling your eyes when they choose the hamburger.

<blockquote>
<i>
A client didn’t like my initial design for her website and asked to meet so she could explain her ideas.
<br>
She brought a poster board covered in shapes cut out from construction paper, vinyl letters, and pictures cut out from magazines. It looked like a 5-year-old’s craft project.
<br>
I mocked it up as best I could. It was still awful.
<br>
She loved it.
</i>
</blockquote>

Of course it looked like a 5-year-old did it, this poor woman is not a designer! The client also had to ask for a meeting to explain her ideas AFTER the designer started designing. This designer could have avoided an awkward situation by having a conversation with the client first to understand her needs and settling her worries by showing how her designs address those needs. Just imagine if a lawyer started working a case and her work was so off base that you felt the need to do your own legal work to get your lawyer back on track. On top of all that, the designer did the job anyway knowing it was bad. Why? A doctor would never get away with caving to a patient that insisted they needed a high powered opioid without first trying to talk them through it. Absolutely no one's a winner in that scenario.

<blockquote>
<i>I work for an ISP that also provides web design. The client was a friend of my boss.</i>
<br>
<br>
Client: I need a website with five pages for my private investigation business.
<br>
Me: Okay – can you describe your business in more detail, or what you’ll need on the website?
<br>
Client: No. But it needs to rank well on Google.
<br>
Me: Well, to do that, I need specifics. What is your company? What services do you provide? What niche are you filling? The more you tell me, the better able I am to develop your SEO.
<br>
Client: It’s your job to figure all that out.
<br>
Me: No, it’s not.
<br>
Client: The company that did my last website researched my company, and provided all the content.
<br>
Me: Well we don’t do that. Anyway, if you give me a few examples websites for what you want, I can get started on designing the page.
<br>
<br>
<i>At this point, he didn’t respond. After 4 weeks of following up to get ANYTHING from him, he calls me:</i>
<br>
<br>
Client: So when will the site be up and running?
<br>
Me: Well, not soon. I wasn’t even sure you wanted to move forward since you weren’t responding to emails or calls and I still don’t have any info or content to work with.
<br>
Client: Why are you giving me such a hard time? It’s your job to build the website, not mine.
<br>
Me: I need something to go on before I can get started, though. I don’t know anything about your company – not even your company name.
<br>
Client: (starting to get upset) Fine. I’ll send a couple of links your way.
<br>
<br>
<i>…And then he doesn’t send me anything. I follow up for 3 weeks and then give up.
<br>
3 months later he calls:</i>
<br>
<br>
Client: Why isn’t my site up yet? I’m frustrated you’re not working faster.
<br>
Me: Well there’s not much we can do if you’re not willing to work with us.
<br>
Client: Fine. Let’s meet tomorrow so we can talk about how to get going with this. 
<br>
<br>
<i>We schedule the meeting and of course, he doesn’t show. I follow up with him and hear nothing for weeks. I give up again. 6 months later he calls to my boss to complain about how horrible I am at my job and that he is getting nowhere with me, and that he’s had to follow up with me several times but I still haven’t made his website live yet.
<br>
<br>
The story has a happy ending, though. I read in the news a few days later that the guy was arrested for impersonating an officer and conducting private investigative work without a license.</i>

This designer messed up a few times and could have avoided everything by acknowledging the very obvious red flags at the beginning. If someone doesn't want to provide details about their business, chances are they've either a) not thought through the details of their business long enough and shouldn’t even be talking to a designer yet, or b) engaged in illegal activity. In either case don't do business with these kinds of people.

The designer relies on phrases like it’s "not my job" or “we don’t do that” without ever explaining what he does or what his job is. (I’d argue it was this designer’s job to help the client with content and strategy, but that’s a whole other story). Nobody wants to be bluntly told “no.” Be helpful, be courteous and if something really isn't your job and a client is insisting you do it anyway, clearly and respectfully part ways. There’s nothing wrong with saying “I’m sorry, but I’ve found the best way to maximize my client’s dollars is to collaborate with them early on to ensure the work I produce is an investment to their business and not a cost. I’m happy to set up a time to collaborate with you, but if you want something that’s a little more hands off on your end, I can recommend another partner that can do the work you need.” Case closed. There's no need to be an abrasive know-it-all or to string people along for months on end even if they are jerks.

Also don’t take pleasure in your client’s downfall. That’s a sign of poor character.

<h4>3) You Get Back What You Put into the World</h4>

What strikes some people as odd when first learning martial arts is that one of the core teachings of many disciplines is to respect everyone, including your opponent. The idea is that most conflicts boil down to people feeling disrespected therefore conveying respect in every part of life dramatically reduces conflict and strengthens your position in real conflict. I encourage you all to listen to author and philosopher Paul K. Chappell’s story about <a href="https://youtu.be/kyo9S2wxGxs?t=3330" target="_blank">how a mini-war almost started over people feeling disrespected over forks</a> to demonstrate the point.

What is respectful about trash talking your clients, the people who want to pay you money in exchange for a service even if they’re acting irrationally? At best, it makes you and other designers feel good for a short while, at worst it solidifies a toxic belief that clients are dumb jerks and designers are delicate creative geniuses that can’t defend themselves. You cannot create good design when your head is full of cynicism.

Good design transforms and elevates ideas into functional systems that serves to enhance the quality of life for the people that interact with our work. That is some powerful stuff and we should be  grateful to be entrusted with that kind of that power. As designers we have a responsibility to ourselves to embody this spirit in every part of our lives. We must turn the negative instances of our lives into positive lessons lest we become the destructive antithesis of who we are in our hearts: creators. We thrive when we make things that serve a purpose. When we behave disrespectfully, unethically, or selfishly we violate the very principle we should be serving and become agents of destruction instead of rebels for positive change. Sacrificing that which makes us whole is not worth the temporary relief of being hurt, angry or annoyed.

I am in no way advocating designers to roll over and take being treated like dirt or turn a blind eye to unethical clients. If you’re legitimately being treated poorly, there is no rule or law saying you have to work for horrible people. However you have to start being a professional. That means drafting contracts, speaking to your clients needs not desires, learning when and how to respectfully say no, helping your clients feel smart, and being respectful. If you are ever stiffed by a client that doesn’t want to pay, calling your lawyer gets you closer to getting your money than grumbling about it to a bunch of 22 year olds on the internet does. Don’t have a lawyer? Get one.

Design is a profession not a gig. We must start treating it like professionals.

You are not a victim.
