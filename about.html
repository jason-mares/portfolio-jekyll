        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Design is the solution to a problem within a set of constraints. By understanding what your users expect and what tangible results you need, design isn't just beautifully presented but informed through research and understanding to achieve the goals you're looking for. Whether it's a poster, catalog, website or ad, your project is in the right hands.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Traditionally a designer hands off a visual to a developer who builds it. Long emails follow, revisions go back and forth and everyone gets tired. As an all-in-one expert, clients save more by elminating these bottlenecks. In the rare instance when another developer is needed I can speak their language and keep projects on track.</p>
