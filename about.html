    <h1>Three Hats, One Expert. Why Pay More for Less?</h1>
    <div class="one-third">
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>Nobody understands your business or organization better than you. My method demystifies the creative process by collaborating with clients from the start to understand the needs of their business & users. This approach eliminates guesswork, reduces objectivity, creates better targeted solutions and makes my clients feel smart & listened to.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Design is the solution to a problem within a set of constraints. By understanding what your users expect and what tangible results you need, design is informed to achieve the goals you're looking forâ€”no more beautiful disasters. Design here follows a very simple principle: think more create less. It's after all for you, not my portfolio.</p>

    <div class="one-third">
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Traditionally a designer hands off a visual to a developer who builds the website. Long emails follow, revisions go back and forth, everyone gets tired and you're confused. As an all-in-one expert clients save more by elminating bottlenecks. In the rare circumstance when another developer is needed, rest assured <code>I speak fluent code.</code></p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <p class="bold">How does your design process work?</p>
        <p>We schedule an initial meeting to figure out what your situation is. From there we can get more in depth about how you want to come across to your audience, who your users are and ways to increase revenue, business efficiency and awareness. The more complex the problem is, the more we collaborate. When work begins, your approval will be required at different milestones to move the project forward.</p>

        <p class="bold">I just need something quick, do we really need to do all that collaboration and research?</p>
        <p>Designers solve problems for their clients. We cannot solve a problem together if we don't understand it. Research and collaboration are crucial for your success. An auto mechanic would never start fixing a car without a thorough diagnostic based on your description of the problem first.</p>

        <p class="bold">What if I already have an idea of what I want?</p>
        <p>Samples and inspiration are welcome but ultimately your logo, website, poster, etc has to work for the people you're trying to communicate with. Most clients know their users well enough not to request pink unicorns in a website designed to be used by Harley riders, but it's my professional responsibility to make sure I'm not just taking your money without question. How much would you trust a doctor that gave out medication without question just because his patients saw one they liked on TV?</p>

        <p class="bold">I need a (website, logo, poster, etc) how much do you charge?</p>
        <p>It depends on your budget, deadline and risk/value ratio. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">Shoot me an email for an estimate</a>.</p>

        <p class="bold">Can I edit your designs?</p>
        <p>If you have paid for your project in full I will transfer the copyright over to you. If you own all the right software to edit the files (I do not provide free copies of software) then it's yours to do what you want.</p>

        <p class="bold">You seem really skilled, are you one of those "jack of all trades master of none?"</p>
        <p>No, I just love what I do. I learned to code when I was 13 and had my first paying freelance gig shortly after graduating high school. I haven't stopped since.</p>
