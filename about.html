        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>Nobody understands your business better than you. My 3-part method called CORE demystifies the creative process by collaborating with clients early on to understand the needs of their business and users. This approach eliminates guesswork, creates better targeted solutions and makes my clients feel smart & listened to.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Design is the solution to a problem within a set of constraints. By understanding what your users expect and what tangible results you need, design isn't just beautifully presented but informed through research and understanding to achieve the goals you're looking for. Think more create less is the idea and it serves my client's interests well.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Traditionally a designer hands off a visual to a developer who builds it. Long emails follow, revisions go back and forth and everyone gets tired. As an all-in-one expert, clients save more by elminating these bottlenecks. In the rare instance when another developer is needed I can speak their language and keep projects on track.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <p class="bold">How does your design process work?</p>
        <p>We schedule an initial meeting to figure out what your situation is. From there we can get more in depth about how you want to come across to your audience, who your users are and ways to increase revenue, business efficiency and awareness. The more complex the problem is, the more we collaborate. When work begins, your approval will be required at different milestones to move the project forward.</p>

        <p class="bold">I just need something quick, can we skip the research?</p>
        <p>Designers solve problems for their clients. We cannot solve a problem together if we don't understand it. Research and collaboration are crucial for your success. An auto mechanic would never start fixing your car without first performing a diagnostic that not only factors in your description of the problem, but how that problem affects the entire car. Your business or ideas are much more valuable than a car.</p>

        <p class="bold">What if I already have an idea of what I want?</p>
        <p>Samples and inspiration are welcome but ultimately your logo, website, poster, etc has to work for the people you're trying to communicate with. Most clients know their users well enough not to request pink unicorns in a website designed to be used by Harley riders, but it's my professional responsibility to make sure I'm not just taking your money without question. How much would you trust a doctor that gave out medication without discussing with patients why they were asking for it?</p>

        <p class="bold">I need a (website, logo, poster, etc) how much do you charge?</p>
        <p>It depends on your budget, deadline and value/risk ratio. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/">Shoot me an email for an estimate</a>.</p>

        <p class="bold">Can I edit your designs?</p>
        <p>If you have paid for your project in full I will transfer the copyright over to you. If you own all the right software to edit the files (I do not provide free copies of software) then it's yours to do what you want.</p>

        <p class="bold">You seem <i>really</i> skilled, are you one of those "jack of all trades master of none?"</p>
        <p>No, I just love what I do. A supportive English teacher taught me how to code when I was 13 and I got better by creating custom myspace profiles for my friends. I got my first paying freelance gig shortly after graduating high school then never thought about doing anything else. This discipline captures my fascination and I'm constantly learning new ways to improve.</p>
