The flagship brand of a lift kit and accessories manufacturer, Supreme Suspensions wanted to earn more revenue as their WordPress shop was beginning to show its age. We set out to design a mobile-first solution for these four problems:

1. Reduce confusion with a unified brand look.
2. Optimize website for conversions.
3. Decrease page load times to 0:02 seconds.
4. Create a logical navigation system.
