The flagship brand of a lift kit and accessories manufacturer, Supreme Suspensionsâ„¢ wanted to earn more revenue as their WordPress shop was beginning to show its age. Brand confusion was compounded when the multi-million dollar brand had no established style guide and a team of designers adhering to different styles. We set out to design solutions for these four problems:

1. Create style guide to align team with the goal of increasing ad and marketing effectiveness.
2. Redesign a mobile-first website with a 2% conversion rate goal.
3. Decrease page load times to > 0:02 seconds.
4. Create a logical navigation system.
