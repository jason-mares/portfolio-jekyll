Breeseway was the culmination of Thomas Breese's 40+ years in the door and hardware consulting industry, having served architects and building owners of some of the world's most iconic structures. As an independent consultant, Breeseway was free to recommend solutions to solve his clients problems vs. solutions his former bosses thought would increase their profitsâ€”a common problem his clients have to be aware of when choosing an expert to hire. An identity and website set out to solve the following problems:

1. Position Breeseway as the "anti-corporate stooge"
2. Convey seasoned experience
3. A website that spoke to his clients needs and pain-points
