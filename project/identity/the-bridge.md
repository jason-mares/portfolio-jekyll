The Bridge was eager to break ground on property it had finally been given the right to build on after years of lengthy litigation and costly moves. To celebrate the building of a new home coinciding with its 60 year anniversary, an identity refresh was commissioned to commemorate its history, welcome newcomers and celebrate the different congregations that had grown into a tight-knit community.
