Heavy Metal® had a fantastic concept: specialize in all-steel custom auto parts that conveyed the dependable strength of steel with the swagger of a rockstar. The original brand image relied heavily on 80's heavy metal imagery that began to feel out of place with the company's growing responsibilities…it was time for Metallica to cut their hair. A redesign was commissioned to accomplish three goals:
1. Mature the brand with a new logo that works in many applications.
2. Position the company as an authority of steel-made aftermarket auto parts.
3. Keep the heavy metal soul without selling out.
