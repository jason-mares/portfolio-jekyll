Showing strong potential in the aftermarket lift kit space, Heavy Metal Suspensions had a fantastic concept: selling all steel suspension parts that conveyed the dependable strength of steel with the swagger of a rockstar. Their original brand image relied heavily on tropes & clichés associated with 80's metal culture and over-the-top graphics that felt out of place with a company generating over $2 million in annual sales and employing a growing and knowledgable staff. A redesign was commissioned to accomplish three goals: 1) mature the brand with new logo that will work in various applications, 2) position the company as an authority of steel-made aftermarket auto parts and 3) keep the heavy metal music feel without resorting to tropes and clichés.
